# BathBodyWorks

This is my first Individual project on which Im working.
I have cloned the website named bathbodyworks, a usa origin ecommerce website, where you can purchase cosmetic products available on the website.
The website i have cloned using HTML, CSS and mainly JavaScript.
The Landing Page, i.e.index.html page has header consist of a User logo by clicking on which redirects you to signup/login page.
Signup page stores the input credential in local sotrage, and retrive at login page.
If you login successfully it will redirect you to Main Page.
Landing page as well as all pages containes a navbar by clicking on which you will able to see different kinds of products available on website.
as you click on the add to bag button, the perticular product add's into Bag icon in header, By clicking on Bag button, it will redirects you to cart.html page..
In cart.html page you will be able to see the number of products you have added.
There is checkout button, as if you wish to purchase the particular item, click on checkout button and you will be redirected to Checkout page.
Checkout page ask's you to fill your all the details, name, address etc., by clicking on confirm button your information will be stored in local storage, and
